# PyBer Analysis

# # Overview
For this analysis, we are trying to analyize the ride-sharing data in three different city types (Rural, Suburban and Urban).  
We would compare the total rides, total drivers, total fare, average fare per ride and average fare per driver between the three city types.  
We will pick a sampled date between 2019 Jan and Apr to analyize the weekly fare for each city types.

In term of total rides, rural has only 125 rides (5%) of the total rides (2375). Lesser rides, lesser income. The  fare for rural is $4327.93 (7%) of the total fares.  
For Suburban area, it has 626 (26%) of the total rides, and the fare is $19,356.33 (30%) of the total fares.  
For Urban area, it has 2375 (68%) of the total rides, and the fare is $39,854.38 (63%) of the total fares.  
So we can confirm the fare is increase proportionally with the number of rides.  

In term of total drivers, rural has way less drivers than suburban and urban. Comparing 78 to 490 and 2405 drivers. Total drivers in rural is only 3% of the total drivers available.  
The more drivers might not be better.   
  * For example, in rural each driver can have 1.60 rides (125/78). But for urban drivers, there are not enough rides for all drivers,; so some drivers is not making any money.
  * The drivers in rural make more in average than drivers in suburban and urban. The drivers in rural area make $55.49 and drivers in sururban makes only $39.50 and $16.57.  

The average fare per ride in rural ($34.62) is higher comparing to suburban and urban.   
Either because the distance in rural area can be farther or the drivers can charge higher price since demand is higer that supply.  

When we review the weekly chart, it matched our prior analysis that urban fare are way higher that suburban and rural.   
It is very interesting that all three area have a peak at the end of Feb.   
Suburban and rural are pretty steady very week except the peak a the end of Feb; but urban is fluctuate.  

# # Summary
Based on the results, here are my three recomemndations:  
1) We need less drivers in the urban area. We have more than enough drivers in urban area.   
    * With lessor drivers, more drivers can make more rides and make more income.   
    * we can filter by hiring only good quality drivers  
    
2) We need to increase rides in rural area. We need to figure why there are less demand in rural area.   
    * Is it because we don't have enough drivers, so the wait for a ride is longer?  
    * Or could that be technology barrier in the rural area?  

3) We need to find out why the demand is so high in the urban area so we can use that strategy for rural and sururban area.  
    * Are there mores bar in the urban area and who needs more ride-sharing services?  
    * Or maybe the traffic is so bad in the urban area that more people don't want to drive? So use ride-sharing service instead?
